# xcode-templates

This project contains my custom XCode project and file templates.
Please feel free to use them as you wish. If you find bugs or have improvement
suggestions, please feel free to shoot me a pull request.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the files in to your personal templates directory

```bash
rake install
```

### Uninstall

If find that you do not what to include the templates, they can be easy removed without affecting any of the other existing templates.

```bash
rake uninstall
```

## Example Usage

The templates will now show up in XCode when you try to create a new file or project.

To create a new file base on one of your templates, select *File > New... > File* in the Menu
